#  class SwissRandom
The class generates a (random) set of coordinates in the common Swiss LV95 system within the borders of Switzerland and/or checks if they are in the country.

~~It also supports WSG84 and the obsolete LV03 coordinate system.~~ The class can also be used to check if existing coordinates are within Switzerland.

## Swiss coordinate system
The Swiss coordinate system (or Swiss grid) is a geographic coordinate system used in Switzerland
and Liechtenstein for maps and surveying by the Swiss Federal Office of Topography (Swisstopo).

## Missing features:

- A set of user-defined minimum and maximum coordinates to limit the result to a specific area.
- Support for WSG84 and the old LV03 coordinate systems.
- Conversion between the three coordinate systems.
